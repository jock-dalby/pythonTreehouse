# python

Python is a general purpose dynamically compiled language, which means that Python is used for a lot of different things and that's compiled on the fly without needing a special compilation or processing step. Java for example is also general purpose language but it is compiled or converted from code to a language that computers speak in a separate step. Python is compiled and run all in one step.

Python is sometimes described as a batteries included language because Python gives you a ton of tools and functionality right out of the box. All of these tools collectively make up the Python Standard Library. The Standard Library is huge and there are tools for working with CSV files, creating calendars or any number of other things. See import in 'number_game.py'.
