# python

Python is a general purpose dynamically compiled language, which means that Python is used for a lot of different things and that's compiled on the fly without needing a special compilation or processing step. Java for example is also general purpose language but it is compiled or converted from code to a language that computers speak in a separate step. Python is compiled and run all in one step.
